Cal Hacks 4.0 was the fourth iteraion of Cal Hacks, the world's largest collegiate hackathon. Throughout 2017, I created the branding for <a href="https://calhacks.io#hackathon" target="_blank" class="cycle">Cal Hacks 4.0</a> under the general guidance of a California road trip theme, in celebration of the fact that advanced and beginner hackers alike come to California from all over the world to hack with us in Berkeley.

Every iteration of Cal Hacks gets dressed in a new bear named dd0ski. dd0ski is aptly named &mdash; a

<a href="https://calspirit.berkeley.edu/oski/history.php" target="_blank" class="cycle">Oski</a>
 is UC Berkeley's mascot.  I designed the Cal Hacks 4.0 dd0ski as the central component of our hackathon's visual identity â€” this little guy was featured on thousands of shirts, swag bags, badges, wristbands, and more.

Cal Hacks 4.0 was marketed to tens of thousands of people around the country. We ultimately ended up hosting over 2000 participants at
<a href="http://www.californiamemorialstadium.com/" target="_blank" class="cycle">California Memorial Stadium</a>. Badges, shirts, wristbands, banners, posters, maps, flyers, Snapchat filters, countdowns, decals, and more were all part of the agenda &mdash; below is a complialtion of some of the final products.

## Products

Attendees consisted of hackers, volunteers, sponsors, and mentors &mdash; each of which had a different type of badge. All attendees were also given wristbands for security purposes.

The hackathon itself was 36 hours straight, filled with lots of moving boxes, distributing food, helping hackers, making sure sponsors felt at home, and hanging out with everyone who stopped by (even some four-legged friends!)

## Marketing

We put in a lot of marketing effort in the months leading up to Cal Hacks, resulting in over 4000 applications from hackers around the globe. The week before the hackathon, I created some countdown graphics to post daily on our Facebook page honoring our California heritage, corporate sponsors, and hackathon fuel sponsors.

## Design Implications

Designing for such a large-scale event gave me the opportunity to make design decisions affecting logistics, organization, accessibility, and more. I designed maps for venue accessibility, organized sign design & placement to optimize the hacker and sponsor check-in process, and created badge checklists to streamline snacks & meals.

These design decisions affected more than just the visual branding of the hackathon &mdash; they guided the logistics of a 2000+ person event held across five stories of a collegiate football stadium. This experience tangibly exemplifies the power of good design in organization.

## Takeaways

Cal Hacks 4.0 was my first experience ideating, executing, & expanding a branding image that thousands of people interacted with. Cal Hacks is an immense part of the Berkeley CS community, so I never go a day on campus without seeing a student decked out in a 4.0 shirt or with a dd0ski sticker on their laptop. I'm very thankful to have made a lasting impact on my (and other!) university's campus through my designs.
