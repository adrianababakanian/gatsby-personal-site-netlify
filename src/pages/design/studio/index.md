blurb: |
  Develop and design Mapbox Studio, a browser-based design tool that enables anyone to create beautiful, radically custom maps.
  I’ve had the opportunity to help out with a little bit of everything, from building interfaces for easily using complex geospatial data pipelines, to architecting sustainable, maintainable design systems for a highly interactive and powerful editor.
